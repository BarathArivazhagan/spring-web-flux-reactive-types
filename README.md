# spring-web-flux-reactive-types
This repository breaks down learning of reactive types such as Mono and Flux. This repository contains examples using these reactive types in Spring5 Web Flux Framework

## Documentation:

#### What is a Reactor ? 

Reactor = single threaded event loop that receives and processes requests.

#### What is Reactor Pattern ? 

The reactor design pattern is an event handling pattern for handling service requests delivered concurrently to a service handler by one or more inputs. The service handler then demultiplexes the incoming requests and dispatches them synchronously to the associated request handlers.






## REST endpoint mappings:

    <td>returns flux of strings created using Flux.fromArray()</td>

   </tr>
